    question: "Do you charge hourly or per project?",
    answer:
      "I typically work on a **fixed-price basis** for well-defined projects, so you know exactly what you're paying upfront. For ongoing maintenance or vague scopes, I offer a competitive hourly rate.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you handle just the Backend/API part?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. If you already have a frontend team, I can step in as a **Backend Specialist** to build secure, documented REST APIs using Django & Django REST Framework that your team can easily consume.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you handle hosting and deployment?",
    answer:
      "Yes. I don't just write the code; I launch it. I can set up your infrastructure on platforms like **AWS, DigitalOcean, or Vercel**, including domain configuration and SSL certificates.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will I own the source code?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Once the final payment is made, **you own 100% of the intellectual property** and source code. I will hand over all repositories and access keys to you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you fix or upgrade an existing website?",
    answer:
      "Yes. whether it's refactoring a slow Django backend or migrating a legacy React site to Next.js, I can audit your current codebase and implement performance improvements.",
  },
